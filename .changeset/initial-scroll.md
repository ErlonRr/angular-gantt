New `initialScroll` option: `'auto'` (default) centres today only when it is near the tasks and otherwise shows the earliest task, so the first view always has bars; also `'today'`, `'start'`, a `Date` or `false`. Zooming now keeps the date at the viewport centre in place, an earlier range start no longer shifts the view, and smooth scrolling honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.
